# Johnny Gaffey's dotfiles

## History
I used ryanb's dotfiles (https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for inspiration in creating my dotfiles. In fact, I lifted his Rakefile line for line.

## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/gkirkpatrick/dotfiles-1.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `sudo apt install rake`
- `rake install`

## Environment
I do most of my work in Linux terminals. I use bash most of the time but I have included zsh files for future adventures.

## Dependencies
- git
- rake
- host
- whois
